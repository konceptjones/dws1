            <div id="content">
               <p>Owner Mike Bradshaw and Chef/Owner John Koneset seek to provide an intimate experience in their eleven seat restaurant focusing on modern Omakase style dining. The idea of Omakase, which loosely translates to <em>"let me choose for you",</em> is to place your trust in the hands of the chef, allowing him to select the most fresh and fitting dishes. This trust between the diner and the Itamae(chef) provides an opportunity for a unique and ever evolving dining experience.</p>

Koneset finally discovered his calling under the mentorship of acclaimed sushi chef Masato Shimizu of Michelin-starred 15 East. From there, he went to train in Tokyo under Shimizu’s mentor, Rikio Kugo of the renowned Sukeroku. While studying in Japan, Koneset made some deep connections in the fishing community</p>
