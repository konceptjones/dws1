            <div id="content">
        <p>Owner Mike Bradshaw and Chef/Owner John Koneset seek to provide an intimate experience in their eleven seat restaurant focusing on modern Omakase style dining. The idea of Omakase, which loosely translates to <em>"let me choose for you",</em> is to place your trust in the hands of the chef, allowing him to select the most fresh and fitting dishes. This trust between the diner and the Itamae(chef) provides an opportunity for a unique and ever evolving dining experience.</p>
